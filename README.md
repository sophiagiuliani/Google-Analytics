# Google-Analytics

 This is an ongoing project for a company that has a online store. Most of sales are made directly with clients on Instagram, but the owner wants to increase the sales made directly on the website. In order to do so, I will use Google Analytics to create custom events, implement URL's, connect Google Analytics with Google Ads and create dashboards. After this first step I will present a report with marketing campaigns results, audience profile, and most used traffic sources. 

 ### Attribution report

  Metrics and dimensions of the attribution report were edited to show relevant data for the business.

 One of the problems of the attribution report is the data when analysing number sessions by session origin. The store uses a tool that allows users to create a landing page with links to their social media profiles. The URL of this tool is what appears as "session's origin", instead of the social media itself. Not knowing exatly from which platform the user arrived from can affect the real numbers. 
 To solve this problem I will propose the store to use UTM parameters (tags added at the end of a URL) to track the performance of this tool links across different social media platforms. Once the tags are added, it is possible to see the results in the campaigns section of the google analytics reports. 
 

   This project will be updated weekly.
