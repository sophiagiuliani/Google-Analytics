# Google-Analytics

 This is an ongoing project for a company that has a online store. Most of sales are made directly with clients on Instagram, but the owner wants to increase the sales made directly on the website. In order to do so, I will use Google Analytics to create custom events, implement URL's, connect Google Analytics with Google Ads and create dashboards. After this first step I will present a report with marketing campaigns results, audience profile, and most used traffic sources. 

 ### Attribution report

  Metrics and dimensions of the attribution report were edited to show relevant data for the business.

   This project will be updated weekly.
